            His position at Oppenheimer Funds was front end but he loved to take on new challenges such as the VPN server he set up at home or his personal website fully built on Ruby on Rails. I would highly recommend him in any role knowing fully that he will rise to the occasion, and enjoy every moment of it.

            RBSI initially hired Thomas for a 2 month project for some web related development we needed for one of our customers. Thomas did such an outstanding job for us that the assignment stretched to 7 months. We plan on using Thomas again on upcoming projects we have slated. Not only did Thomas do exceptionally good work for us - but he has a great attitude and interfaces extremely well with the end customer.

            Thomas is very adept at quickly learning what we needed from a graphics perspective, despite hazy directive. He always delivered on-time or ahead of time and his work was top quality. I look forward to asking Thomas to work on future projects...

            I had the pleasure of working with Thomas Wicker during my time with AT&T, formally Cricket Communications. I was brought on to Thomas's development team in late 2013 and with his guidance as team-lead we successfully delivered a robust, Enterprise User-Interface for Cricket Wireless.

            Thomas possessed excellent leadership skills as a project-manager, and as a colleague he was essential in excelling the project above and beyond the initial scope. Thomas's rich background in art and design gives him an a eye for intuitive User Experience and he is a excellent Front-End Developer. I would highly recommend him for any UI/UX development project.
